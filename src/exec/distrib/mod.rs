//! The distrib module provides methods for executing the rendering in a
//! distributed environment across multiple machines. The worker module provides
//! the Worker which does the actual job of rendering a subregion of the image.
//! The master module provides the Master which instructs the Workers what to render
//! and collects their results to save out the final image.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! The worker process takes very few arguments, just a flag indicating it's a worker
//! and optionally the number of threads to use with `-n`.
//!
//! ```text
//! ./tray_rust --worker
//! ```
//!
//! The worker processes will listen on a hard-coded port for the master to send them instructions
//! about what parts of the image they should render. This is `exec::distrib::worker::PORT` which
//! you can change and re-compile if the default of 63234 conflicts with other applications.
//!
//! The master process can be run on the same machine as a worker since it doesn't take
//! up too much CPU time. To run the master you'll pass it the scene file, a list of the
//! worker hostnames or IP addresses and optionally an output path and start/end frame numbers.
//! You can also run tray\_rust with the `-h` or `--help` flag to see a list of options.
//!
//! ```text
//! ./tray_rust cornell_box.json --master worker1 worker2 192.168.32.129
//! ```
//!
//! The master will send the workers the location of the scene file which is assumed to
//! be on some shared filesystem or otherwise available at the same path on all the workers.
//!
//! # Running on GCE or EC2
//!
//! You can run on any network of home machines but you can also run on virtual machines from
//! Google or Amazon if you want to rent a mini cluster. On GCE or EC2 you'll want machines in the
//! same region for faster communication and will then pass the local IPs of the workers to
//! the master. For example on GCE you're given a virtual local network, you would use
//! these IP addresses instead of the public IPs of the worker nodes.
